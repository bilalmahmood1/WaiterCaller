# Simple Waiter Calling App for Restaurant owners
Simple Waiter caller App that allows restaurant owners to use technology to know when their customers need a waiter. 
The restuarant owner places a small url on each table which a customer makes a request on to call a waiter. Each
request is logged on the dashboard that is visible to the restaurant owner. 
Below are screen shots of the application
